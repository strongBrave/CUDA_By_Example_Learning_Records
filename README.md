# CUDA By Example - Learning Records

This repository is dedicated to recording and documenting my journey through the book [CUDA by Example](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-example). The goal is to deepen my understanding of CUDA programming by implementing and experimenting with the examples and concepts presented in the book.

## 📘 About the Book

CUDA By Example is a comprehensive guide to GPU programming with NVIDIA's CUDA platform. It introduces the fundamental concepts of parallel programming and GPU computing, walking through real-world examples and hands-on exercises. The book is ideal for those who want to learn how to harness the power of GPUs for high-performance computing.

## 🔍 Repository Overview

This repository contains:
- **Code Implementations**: Source code from the examples in the book, adapted and extended for deeper learning.
<!-- - **Experiment Results**: Outputs and performance analyses from running the examples on my GPU.
- **Additional Notes**: Key takeaways, challenges, and explanations for important CUDA concepts.
- **Custom Extensions**: Variations and experiments based on the book’s examples to explore more advanced or alternative CUDA programming techniques. -->
